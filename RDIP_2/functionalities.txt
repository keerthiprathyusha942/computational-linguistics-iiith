1)Click on the experiment tab.
2)You get a dropdown with English, Hindi and Select Language as the options.
3)So lets understand how English sentences work. We select English from the dropdown.
4)You get a dropdown saying “Select a sentence” that has multiple English Sentences. The same dropdown is populated
 with Hindi Sentences if Hindi had been chosen from the first dropdown.
5)Let us take the sentence, “She was stopped by the bravest knight.” As soon as we select this sentence, a message is 
displayed “Select the POS tag for corresponding words” along with a table being created having four columns.
6)The first column(heading as Lexicon) is populated with the selected sentence, the second column(heading POS) contains a 
dropdown that is populated with multiple POS tags and this dropdown can be seen for as many rows as there in the first 
column. The default dropdown value for all dropdowns should be Noun. The third and fourth columns are for now empty.
7)You can choose from the dropdowns and whenever you think you have made the choice of the correct POS tags, you can 
click Submit and the third column now becomes populated with a tick or a cross pertaining to whether the choice you made 
in the dropdown and the actual correct POS tag match or not.
8)If all your POS tags are correct, and the third column is filled with all green ticks, the experiment is over. But if, 
any of the rows of the third column are filled with a red cross, a button is displayed saying “Get Answer” wherein if 
clicked, the fourth and final column is populated with the actual correct POS Tags.
